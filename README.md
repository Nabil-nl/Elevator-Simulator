# ELEVATOR SIMULATOR

An interactive **Elevator Simulator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates how a real elevator works  moving between floors, opening and closing doors, and handling multiple requests smoothly.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Select one or more floors (`R0`–`R4`) to call the elevator.  
2. Each call appears on the digital display.  
3. Press **Start** to begin — the elevator closes its doors, moves to each floor in order, and opens the doors again.  
4. Press **Restart** — the elevator closes its doors, returns gracefully to the ground floor (`R0`), and reopens.

 **Enjoy!**
